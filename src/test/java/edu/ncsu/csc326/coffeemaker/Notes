- constructor without parameters: use of setter to add values
- Only positive int values, passed as a string (uses Interger.parseInt())

 get()  (1)
 set():
     Normal : positive, negative, char, null, double, empty string (6)
 ParseInt() : postive int and negative int (2)

 Line coverage: Not possible in the equals function, name cannot be set to null
 therefore there are 2 lines of code that are never executed. test 39 .
